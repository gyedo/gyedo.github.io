When we first came to the U.S. for my work, we were a young couple who had been married for three years. While I was struggling to establish a career here, my wife was dealing with her own hardships, mostly due to having no local connections. Then, she found a new passion and began this journey while raising our teenage daughter.

After enduring many late nights of hard work and navigating the unexpected events of raising a teenager, she finally saw our daughter off to college and celebrated her own graduation from ArtCenter.

When I saw so many people from the various circles she has built visiting her exhibition, I realized she had truly found her footing and established a foundation for her own growth. I am so happy for her and incredibly proud of her. I can’t wait to see where she goes from here.
