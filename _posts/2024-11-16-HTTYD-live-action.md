title: How To Train Your Dragon live-action
---

I think it was back in 2023 when the news about the live-action remake of *How To Train Your Dragon* first came out. Disney has been remaking their animated films since 1994, but I think audiences are already getting tired of these remakes after so many. Naturally, many were skeptical about the remake plan, but there was a silver lining: Dean DeBlois, the co-director of the original animated film, would direct this live-action adpataion.

And yesterday, the first image from this live-action adapataion was revealed, and of course, many people started to complain about it. The most common complaint would be why there are so many of these remakes. Even though I understand the sentiment becuase it's true, I'd like to point out that, as far as I know, this is the first remake from Universal. So let's give it the benefit of the doubt and wait to see it on the big screen on June 13, 2025.
