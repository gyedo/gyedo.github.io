title: Thanksgiving Day

I first came to the U.S. on the eve of Thanksgiving in 2002, November 27th. Even though my very first visit to the U.S. was in the summer of 2002 for the SIGGRAPH conference, this time I came with my wife to the U.S. to possibly stay.

At that time, I was working for a small startup in Korea, trying to build a business around cloud rendering services. But since there were no business opportunities in Korea, they sent me to the U.S. to help set up a Hollywood branch. Having been married for less than three years, I couldnâ€™t leave my wife for this uncertain, long business trip. So, I brought her with me, thinking this could last at most six months, so that while I was working, she could spend time learning English.
