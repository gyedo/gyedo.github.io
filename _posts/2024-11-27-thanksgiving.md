I first came to the U.S. on the eve of Thanksgiving in 2002, November 27th. Even though my very first visit to the U.S. was in the summer of 2002 for the SIGGRAPH conference, this time I came with my wife to the U.S., and we've been here ever since.

At that time, I was working for a small startup in Korea, trying to build a business around cloud rendering services. But since there were no business opportunities in Korea, they sent me to the U.S. to help set up a Hollywood branch. Having been married for less than three years, I couldnâ€™t leave my wife for this uncertain, long business trip. So, I brought her with me, thinking this could last at most six months, hoping that while I was working, she could spend time learning English.

This year, the eve of Thanksgiving is again on November 27th, and all the memories of past days since 2002 flash back. I feel a bit of melancholy for my younger self from 22 years ago, thinking about all the troubles and hardships he would experience. At the same time, I envy his youth, energy, and hope for the future. But most of all, I feel thankfulness for all the blessings I have received until now on this Thanksgiving Day eve.
