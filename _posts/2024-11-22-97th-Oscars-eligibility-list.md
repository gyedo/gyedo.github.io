title: Eligibility list for the 97th Oscars Animated Feature Film
---

Yesterday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the feature films eligible for consideration in the Animated Feature Film category for the 97th Academy Awards. Honorably, *Kung Fu Panda 4*, on which I had the privilege of being the lead TD, and *The Wild Robot* from DreamWorks Animation made it to that list along with other films like *Inside Out 2* from Pixar and *Moana 2* from Disney.

Even though I worked on *Kung Fu Panda 4*, I honestly don't think it will be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film. However, I strongly believe *The Wild Robot* will be nominated and could win the award. Because *Kung Fu Panda 4* is not to the academy's taste, but *The Wild Robot* surely is.
