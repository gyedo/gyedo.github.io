title: So Many Things Happened in 2025
---

Ever since I wrote the Happy New Year post, so many things have happened in 2025.

There were those fires, I turned 50, my kid graduated from high school and started university, and I was promoted to Supervising Technical Director.

The project I'm currently working on hasn't been publicly announced yet, but it's definitely an interesting one. I hope I can share more about it soon.
