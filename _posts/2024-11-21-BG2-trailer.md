title: The Bad Guys 2 trailer
---

Today, the official trailer for the upcoming DreamWorks animated film, The Bad Guys 2, was released. (Click the image below to watch the trailer.) Even though I didn't participate in the making of this movie, I work closely with the team and am so happy to see this trailer. But I saw that some people on the internet are demanding more original films from DreamWorks.

As our president Margie mentioned in her Variety interview, [“We are committed to two movies a year -- one original, one franchise and one opportunistic third, as we like to call it. And next year, ‘Dog Man’ is that opportunistic third.”](https://variety.com/lists/power-women-hollywood-2024/margie-cohn-3/) This year, 'Kung Fu Panda 4' was the franchise and "The Wild Robot" was the original.

And next year, as Margie said, 'Dog Man' is that opportunistic third, and 'The Bad Guys 2' is, of course, the franchise. So, what will be our original film for next year? Deadline already reported on April 25, 2024: [DreamWorks Animation Dates Big-Screen Version Of Netflix Series ‘Gabby’s Dollhouse’ For Fall 2025](https://deadline.com/2024/04/gabbys-dollhouse-dreamworks-animation-release-date-1235895407/)
