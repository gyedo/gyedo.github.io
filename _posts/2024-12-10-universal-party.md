title: Cheers to 30 Years Celebration at Universal Studios Hollywood
---

Yesterday, DreamWorks celebrated its 30th anniversary at Universal Studios Hollywood with employees and their families. For this event, we had the upper lot of Universal Studios Hollywood to ourselves, and all the food and drinks were free. I brought my wife with me, and we really enjoyed this special night together. It reminds me of our first visit to Universal Studios Hollywood in 2002 and the holiday party for Disney employees at Disneyland in 2010.

When we first came to the U.S., since I was working in Hollywood, we visited Universal Studios Hollywood with my co-workers. That first impression resurfaced last night. The park has changed so much since then, but nostalgic moments still remain. That night at Disneyland in 2010 was similar to yesterday; they closed the park only for Disney employees, and there were free food and drinks. One difference is that yesterday, alcoholic drinks were also free, which wasn't the case at Disneyland.

At the park yesterday, I met so many co-workers whom I really like and enjoy working with. I had to stop and say hi so many times that later my wife teased me about it. Additionally, I was able to meet many former colleagues whom I miss working with. For that reason alone, it was a truly meaningful and wonderful night.
