title: Cheers to 30 Years Celebration at Universal Studios Hollywood
---

Yesterday, DreamWorks celebrated its 30th anniversary at Universal Studios Hollywood with employees and their families. For this event, we had the upper lot of Universal Studios Hollywood to ourselves, and all the food and drinks were free. I brought my wife with me, and we really enjoyed this special night together. It reminds me of our first visit to Universal Studios Hollywood in 2002 and the holiday party for Disney employees at Disneyland in 2010.
