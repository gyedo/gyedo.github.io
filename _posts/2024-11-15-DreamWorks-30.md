title: "Re: Reflecting on 30 years of DreamWorks Animation"
---

AWN has published this interesting interview article, https://www.awn.com/animationworld/reflecting-30-years-dreamworks-animation, where they interviewed Chris Sanders, Raymond and Christopher Zibach, Rebecca Huntley, Joel Crawford, and Jason Mayer.
Among those I worked with Joel on *Croods: A New Age (2020)* and *Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)*, Rebecca and Jason on *Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024)*.

While reading that article mostly nodding since I feel the same way as interviewees, I was surprised to find out that Christopher is the son of Raymond! There are other familes working togehter at DreamWorks; couples, father and daughters...

Hope this family-like work environment would last longer.
