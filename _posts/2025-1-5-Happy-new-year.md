title: Happy New Year!
---

I can't believe it's already 2025. I still remember feeling awkward writing 2024, but now I have to get used to writing 2025. Regardless, happy new year!

I've been on vacation for two weeks, and tomorrow is my first workday of 2025. Especially since I'm working on an animated feature film scheduled to be released in 2026, I'll be very busy this year. Thinking about that I'm both excited and anxious.

What are your plans for 2025? I hope you have a wonderful year fulfilling everything you've planned.
